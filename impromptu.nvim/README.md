Create prompts fast and easy

## What?

Impromptu is a lua utility for neovim that allows you to easily create prompts as means of causing commands/functions to be called on neovim.

It is designed in a way that it should be simple to create and reuse prompts for whatever need you have.

The root problem it was meant to solve was changing configurations on the flight for other plugins, such as [iron.nvim](https://github.com/Vigemus/iron.nvim).

## How?

Take a look at the docs [here](http://impromptunvim.readthedocs.io/).
